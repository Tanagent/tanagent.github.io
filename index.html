                    <p class="text-faded">My name is Brian Tan and I am a software engineer. I am currently working at McGraw Hill Education in Irvine, CA as a content programmer. One of my biggest passion is technology. I have received my B.S. degree in Computer Science from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (Cal Poly Pomona) and I love learning and expanding my knowledge as much as I can in the software universe. Over the past, I've had amazing work experiences and competed in several local programming competitions that allows me to immerse myself as a developer. Other than technologies, I am a major fan of anime, video games, and climbing rocks.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">It is your own personal virtual trainer on your Android device. Users set the amount of time that they would like to work out for and vTrainer does the rest. Users are allowed to select their own exercises and vTrainer randomly generate those exercises along with rest time in between each exercise. This app was inspired by the idea of personal trainers and how clients would pay hundreds of dollars for someone to tell them what to do. Instead of having someone to tell you, why not have an Android app that does all that for you?</p>
